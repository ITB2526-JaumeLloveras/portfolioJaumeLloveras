# portfolioJaumeLloveras

This project is my **personal portfolio**, where I present information about myself and some of my projects.  
The goal is to showcase my web development skills and organize my work in a clear and visual way.

## Website structure

The portfolio is made up of **three main pages**:

### Home page
This is the main page of the website.  
It includes a brief personal introduction and a section with **featured projects**, where two main projects are displayed and can be visited in detail.

### Projects page
This page displays **30 projects in total**.  
From these projects:
- Only **two projects are fully completed**
- They are the only ones that can be opened and accessed through their own pages
- On these pages, the **full description of the work** can be seen

The rest of the projects are shown only as visual examples.

### Contact page
This page provides a way to get in touch, so that anyone interested can contact me. Have link on mail, git, linkedin and twitter.
